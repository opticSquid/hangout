### Whats in it for businesses

We can provide you with different data points

- About your business
  - users can very easily avail your services whenever they want to
  - you can directly engage with our user base in form of posts(text, photos, short videos or any combination of these three) promoting your offerings and they would be prominently visible to the users with a button to avail your services.
  - engaging with users will help build better relationship with your customers and help increase the amount of returning and new customers.
