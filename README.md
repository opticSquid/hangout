# Hangout

## Introduction

This is a social media app that not only lets you connect with your loved ones through chat and multimedia posts like regular social media apps but also lets you find the best locations for hanging out with them helping you spend a quality time and experience  while taking into account your taste, your location and your budget.

## Whats so unique for the normal users

Hangout besides providing regular social media features (like posting your photos and videos and messaging) it does not treat marketplace as a second class citizen having it as a separate section but tightly integrates marketplace in different sections like:

- you can directly post your views about a place that you have been too earlier. You can mention the business directly in your posts or refer to any of the service it offers. And other users can comment their take or the business can directly reply back to your post addressing your concerns.

- you can directly avail the service of a business may be while chatting with someone or the posts that the business makes itself or from its profile page of the business. (Like booking a table in a restaurant while chatting with someone directly inside the chat or buy a ticket to a concert that you and your friend want to go from a post about that concert).
